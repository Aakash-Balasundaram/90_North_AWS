Steps for running the Project:-

To run your **Next.js project**, follow these steps:

---

### 1. **Ensure Node.js is Installed**
- Verify that Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are installed by running:
  ```bash
  node -v
  npm -v
  ```
- If not installed, download and install from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

---

### 2. **Clone or Copy the Project**
- If the project is in a Git repository, clone it:
  ```bash
  git clone <repository-url>
  ```
- Navigate to the project directory:
  ```bash
  cd path/to/project
  ```

---

### 3. **Install Dependencies**
- Install all the required packages for the project:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
  This will read the `package.json` file and install all dependencies.

---

### 4. **Run the Development Server**
- Start the Next.js development server:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
- This will start the development server at the default address `http://localhost:3000`.

---

### 5. **Open the Application**
- Open a web browser and navigate to:
  ```
  http://localhost:3000
  ```
- You should see the Next.js application running.

---

### 6. **Build the Application for Production**
- To prepare your application for production, run:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
  This will create an optimized production build.

---

### 7. **Run the Production Server (Optional)**
- Start the production server after building the application:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
- By default, the production server also runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

### 8. **Stop the Server**
- Use `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the development or production server.
